| `ANN.py`                         | Data mining application created with Artificial Neural Networks and predicting article category.                                                                                            |
| `ANNInput.py`                    | Data mining application created with Artificial Neural Networks and predicting article category. The article takes the abstract input and as a result returns which category it belongs to. |
| `DecisionTreeClassifier.py`      | Data mining application created with decision trees and predicting article category.                                                                                                        |
| `DecisionTreeClassifierInput.py` | Data mining application created with decision trees and predicting article category. The article takes the abstract input and as a result returns which category it belongs to.             |
